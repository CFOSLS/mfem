This repository is a fork of MFEM, extended with classes for CFOSLS (constrained first-order
system least squares) framework. The underlying version of MFEM is 3.3. The code can be built
in the same way as MFEM, see http://mfem.org/building.

To learn more about MFEM, visit mfem.org and/or read README in https://github.com/mfem/mfem.

Incomplete list of new classes (w.r.t to base version of MFEM):
- ParMeshCyl: a class for handling space-time cylinder meshes with arbitrary base mesh.
- 4D finite element spaces for H(div), H(divskew), H(curl), H^1 and L^2 and 4D meshes 
  (also available in https://github.com/mfem/mfem/tree/4d_dev)
  
- FOSLSFormulation: weak formulation of a (C)FOSLS problem in terms of bilinear and linear forms 
  (BilinearForm- and LinearFormIntegrators in MFEM)
- FOSLSFEFormulation: weak formulation of a FOSLSProblem with spaces specified
  (FiniteElementCollections in MFEM)
- FOSLSProblem: base class for a (C)FOSLS problem on a given mesh
  (incl. FiniteElementSpaces in MFEM)
  
- GeneralHierarchy: hierarchy of meshes and f.e. spaces defined on them
- FOSLSProblHierarchy: hierarchy of FOSLSProblems living at a hierarchy of meshes

- MultigridToolsHierarchy: a hierarchy of various ingredients which could be used for multigrid
  (or other preconditioners), including. e.g., local non-overlapping Schwarz smoothers 
  implemented in LocalProblemSolver class)
- GeneralMultigrid, Multigrid and MonolithicMultigrid: multigrid preconditioners
- GeneralMinConstrSolver: a multilevel minimization solver which solves a CFOSLS problem by 
  minimizing the FOSLS functional subject to the constraint
- DivConstraintSolver: a multilevel method for finding a particular solution to the constraint
  $\div \sigma = f$
  
- TimeStepping: a class for time-slabbing (splitting the problem into space-time slabs and
  solving sub-problems in each time slab)
- TwoGridTimeStepping: for emulating parallel-in-time two-grid solver.

- FOSLSEstimator: error estimator for a FOSLS problem

- Specific integrators and classes for CFOSLS formulation of linear transport, heat, wave and
  laplace equations
  
Incomplete list of features (improvements) upon MFEM:
- 4D finite element spaces & 4D meshes
- general multigrid preconditioners and minimization solver
- time-slabbing
- AMR in FOSLS framework
- various examples of solving PDEs in CFOSLS formulations using the new classes

For examples, see the examples/ directory (and examples/archive for some older example 
codes).
